# Capstone Project U.N.I.T.Y

This is the GitHub repository for our CMS 484 Senior Capstone class. Our goal for this project was to deepen our understanding and knowledge of video game design and development in the Unity Engine. We demonstrated our understanding of the different components of C# and the Unity Engine by creating a turn-based role-playing game that takes place within a unique, perfect maze. 

The learning objectives we set for ourselves are as follows:
  1. Basic Design and Development with the Unity Engine: GameObjects, collisions, interactions, physics, movement,   lighting, etc.
  2. Combining scripts with GameObjects in the Unity Engine
  3. Player Interactions with Hostile and Friendly Non-Player Characters
  4. Particle Effect Systems and Animations
  5. Object-Oriented Design and Development with the C# Programming Language
  6. Environment and Maze Generation

*NOTE: A majority of the prefabs, GameObjects, and materials we use in this project were downloaded through the Unity Asset Store. Thus, credit for the creation of those assets go to their original creators. The majority of the work that we made on this project are the scripts that we created within the Assets folder as well as miscellaneous animations, particle effects, and GameObjects.*
